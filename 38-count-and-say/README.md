**Dificuldade:** Medium  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/

The 'Count and Say' sequence is a sequence of digit strings defined by the recursive formula: countAndSay(1) = '1', and countAndSay(n) is the way of reading the digit string countAndSay(n-1). For example, the digit string '1' is read as 'one 1' or '11', and so on. Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.
