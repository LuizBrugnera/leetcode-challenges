# Search in Rotated Sorted Array (LeetCode #33)

**Dificuldade:** Medium  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/search-in-rotated-sorted-array/

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand. (i.e., [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]). You are given a target value to search. If found in the array, return its index. Otherwise, return -1. You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.
