# LRU Cache (LeetCode #146)

**Dificuldade:** Medium  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/

Design and implement a data structure for a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache. It should support the following operations: get and put. The get function retrieves the value of the specified key if the key exists in the cache. If the key does not exist, return -1. The put function updates the value of the key if the key exists, or inserts the key if it does not. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate the least recently used item before inserting a new item.
