# House Robber III (LeetCode #337)

**Dificuldade:** Medium  
**URL:** https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called the 'root'. Besides the root, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the thief realizes that all houses in this place are arranged in a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses are broken into on the same night. Given the root of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.
