Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given as follows: 

2 -> 'abc'
3 -> 'def'
4 -> 'ghi'
5 -> 'jkl'
6 -> 'mno'
7 -> 'pqrs'
8 -> 'tuv'
9 -> 'wxyz'

Note that 0 and 1 do not map to any letters.
